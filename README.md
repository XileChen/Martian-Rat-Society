# Martian Robot Society

## Overview

**Martian Robot Society** is a simulation project that models a hierarchical society of robots on Mars. The project involves creating interconnected systems representing governance, citizens, and decision-making processes. This program was designed to explore advanced object-oriented programming concepts and hierarchical data modeling.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Society Simulation**: Robots are divided into citizens and leaders, organized into a decision-making hierarchy.
- **Dynamic Roles**: Citizens can perform tasks and interact with their leaders, while leaders make decisions based on collected data.
- **Resource Allocation**: The program models societal behaviors such as resource distribution and task assignments.
- **Data Structures**: Implements tree-based structures to represent hierarchical relationships.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `unittest` for testing
  - `random` for simulating decisions and interactions
- **Concepts**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Tree data structures for hierarchy modeling
  - Simulation and event handling

## Game Mechanics

1. **Hierarchy Design**:
   - Robots are divided into citizens and leaders.
   - Citizens are the base units performing tasks, while leaders make high-level decisions.

2. **Leader Decisions**:
   - Leaders collect data from citizens to make decisions.
   - Decision-making is influenced by predefined rules and simulations.

3. **Tasks and Resources**:
   - Citizens are assigned tasks and interact with leaders to accomplish objectives.
   - Resources are allocated based on citizen performance and leader evaluation.

4. **End Goal**:
   - Simulate a functional Martian society that models governance and decision-making effectively.
